In this project, we have successfully proposed a system where blockchain technology can be used to store and retrieve certificate data. The project will help companies issue certificates securely through Blockchain and can be verified by anyone with the unique link/code to each certificate. The system uses the concept of SVG templates for the certificates which would be stored on a local server and to store data over the blockchain for secure and reliable storage.  This will minimize the cost of storing the entire certificate on the blockchain network. Storing only the data of the certificate will minimize cost and thereby turn out to be cost-efficient. The only drawback of this system is that the template of the certificate needs to be properly created with the SVGâ€™s textarea ID to match with the header of the CSV file. Only a properly crafted SVG and CSV pair will result in proper certificate generation through Blockchain.
